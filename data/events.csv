It’s more than just the low clearance: This exhibition at the Petersen explores the custom paint, engraving, upholstery and, of course, the gravity-defying suspension of the lowrider scene.

0,Cinderella %E2%80%93 An %E2%80%9Cenchanting%E2%80%9D Rudie Decarlo Family Theatre Musical For Kids 2 To,"“Pick of the Month!” Show Time Magazine.
The beloved Rudie-DeCarlo musical CINDERELLA is back for Aug-Sept only, to celebrate its 40th anniversary with a stunning multi-media makeove. It’s Cinderella like you’ve never seen her before, with new songs, hilarious special FX, a silent movie segment that will have you falling out of your seat, dazzling costumes, amazing magical prestidigitation, and a story about being true to your dreams and loving yourself as you are that's as meaningful today as ever before.
“A delight for the entire family!” LA SPLASH
It’s the perfect fairytale for today's generation: a handsome prince (who yearns to be loved for himself, not his royal position), silly stepsisters (who ultimately discover that looks really aren't everything), a feisty (but genuinely well-meaning) stepmother, a silver-foxy (if slightly befuddled) King and a refreshingly independent Cinderella.
""An Enchanting Cinderella!...highlighted by fast pacing, fancy costuming and a lovely, unweepy Cinderella…particularly within the context of Rudie and DeCarlo's trademark Gilbert & Sullivan comic lyrics."" LA Times
After two dozen tours to England, Alaska and Japan, CINDERELLA is still the single most requested Playhouse Musical Matinee on three continents and this delightful 40th anniversary make-over offers added delights: playful period costumes by award-winning designer Ashley Hayes, magical special effects by James Cooper and the heart-warming romance that blooms with the assistance of a glass slipper, a magic wand, and the audience's eager intervention.
""This extraordinary company creates a strange new brand of excitement...Truly imaginative and entertaining, this play has all its spark plugs firing."" - LA PARENT
CINDERELLA features Actors’ Repertory Theatre members James Cooper, Isabel Lindley, SummerAnne Love, J.T. Melagrano, Cydne Moore, Michala Peltz, Graham Silbert and Megan Wright, with special guest Olvia Hurtado as Cinderella. Fairygodmother, of course, plays herself. Directed by Playhouse Co-Artistic Director Chris DeCarlo, book, music & lyrics by DeCarlo and Evelyn Rudie.
Splendid birthday parties, hosted by costumed members of the Cinderella Company, are available with every performance.
""A show that will delight children and adults, even if they think they have seen every possible twist on the Cinderella story."" reviewplays.com

What started as a small festival celebrating three Indigenous playwrights in 1994 has grown to become one of the most renowned Native theaters in the country. In 2024, we are celebrating our 30th Festival of New Plays, our 15th Short Play Festival, our first EMBERS: Young Native Playwrights program, our first Director Mentorship program, and our 30th World Premiere production. We would not be able to do this without your support! To honor this momentous occasion, Native Voices will be hosting our 30th anniversary party during the Festival of New Plays.
As part of Native Voices 10-day Playwrights Retreat, playwrights are partnered with an artistic team and company of actors to explore their scripts. The residency culminates with the Festival of New Plays, where each play is presented as a staged reading at the Autry and La Jolla Playhouse.
We invite you, beloved audience and theatre lovers, to share a toast with us as we welcome two new works: ""Never Say Die"" by Jennifer Bobiwash and ""Feast for the Dead"" by Madeline Easley.
Play Synopsis for ""Never Say Die:"" After a decade and a half of self-imposed detachment, the world's standstill prompts one woman to revisit her past. Returning to the hometown she once walked away from, she is reunited with old friends and family members stirring a mix of emotions, memories, and tensions. Is blood thicker than water? Can we break past cycles or are we doomed to repeat them?
Play Synopsis for ""Feast for the Dead:"" After the fall of the Indian Child Welfare Act in the days leading up to the zombie apocalypse, Kay was illegally adopted out of her Tribe by a wealthy family who then abandoned her when they escaped the carnage by sea. Seven years later, Kay is a thriving citizen of a Confederacy of Tribes who took over governance of Turtle Island after the settler government fell. Just as suddenly as they appeared, the zombies disintegrate, and the one percent return from the sea, ready to re-colonize. The only solution? Revive the centuries-old, Huron-Wendat tradition of holding a Feast for the Dead.",Aug 9,4:00PM - 8:30PM,Autry Museum in Griffith Park,,https://www.discoverlosangeles.com/event/2024/08/09/native-voices-30th-festival-of-new-plays

The stories in this show, however, are all new.
Evy and Oscar have eloped. One of them is a soldier who is about to be deployed. Evy and Oscar will have to cram a honeymoon into a severely restricted amount of time.
Mike is with his new (and second) wife Katie. Mike isn’t sure whether or not he had carnal relations with another woman at his bachelor party. It’s all a haze, now. Did he or didn’t he? The answer comes from an unexpected quarter.
Becca’s besties are there to console her, as it looks like Jeff jilted her at the altar. But is that what happened, really?
The cast includes Jerry Campisi, Whitney Montgomery, Chris Periko, Lilly Weak, Lindsay Shelton, Piper Major, Grace Neiswander, Pete Navis, Stevie Kincheloe, Lindsay Gentile, Erin Astin, and Alex Borja.

71,Afternoons At The Bilbrew Monthly Author Talk Dr Donna J Nicol,"Join us for an enlightening and inspiring event on Saturday, August 10th, at the AC Bilbrew Library. 
We are thrilled to focus on programming for the Black Resource Center, and we have a special guest, ASALH member Dr. Donna J. Nicol, who will be presenting her recently published book, ""Black Woman on Board.""
Date: Saturday, August 10, 2024
Time: 11 AM
Location: AC Bilbrew Library
About the Book
""Black Woman on Board"" explores the vital role Black women educational leaders have played in ensuring access and equity for all. The book focuses on Dr. Claudia H. Hampton's two-decade struggle to advance affirmative action in the California State University system. A key theme in the narrative is Hampton's strategic use of ""sly civility"" to amass soft power and transform the system from within. By disarming racial biases of the trustee board and presenting herself as a reasonable political moderate, Hampton made significant strides while also making dinner for her white male colleagues.
Commemorating a Legacy
2024 marks the 30th anniversary of Claudia Hampton's passing on August 13th. Dr. Nicol's talk will be a perfect way to commemorate Hampton's legacy and her contributions to educational equity.
Engage with Dr. Donna Nichol
Dr. Nicol will deliver a talk about her book and the profound impact of Dr. Hampton's work. If you prefer a more informal format, Dr. Nicol would be honored to have a conversation with you during the book talk, allowing for a deeper and more personal engagement.
Don't miss this opportunity to delve into the history of Black women in educational leadership and to honor a trailblazer's legacy. We look forward to seeing you there!

Cricket has reached the country of baseball and the performance of the home side, USA, will be a big factor in how popular the game gets in America. (More Cricket News)
USA alongside West Indies are co-hosts of the ICC Men's T20 World Cup that begins June 1.
The home side will be entering the prestigious tournament on the back of a confidence-boosting series win against Bangladesh, a Test playing nation. USA defeated Bangladesh in the first two games of the three-match T20I series and then lost the last match after resting their key players.
Led by Monank Patel, the co-hosts will depend heavily on few of their big names to carry them forward in the tournament. Stevan Taylor and Aaron Jones alongside skipper Patel are the big guns in batting while the bowling will be led by Ali Khan, whose exploits in the Caribbean Premier League helped him get picked by Kolkata Knight Riders in the 2020 IPL Auction.
The biggest star in the USA lineup will be without doubt Corey Anderson. The allrounder who once held the record for the fastest century in the history of ODI cricket will have the responsibility to add firepower to the American batting lineup.

Playing a World Cup for the first time, USA have been placed in Group A with India, Pakistan, Ireland and Canada.

79,Launch Party Stephanie Canizales Fidel Martinez,"Join us for the launch of SIN PADRES, NI PAPELES by Stephanie L. Canizales, in conversation with Fidel Martinez!
ABOUT THE BOOK:
Each year, thousands of youth endure harrowing unaccompanied and undocumented migrations across Central America and Mexico to the United States in pursuit of a better future. Drawing on the firsthand narratives of migrant youth in Los Angeles, California, Stephanie L. Canizales shows that while a lucky few do find reprieve, many are met by resource-impoverished relatives who are unable to support them, exploitative jobs that are no match for the high cost of living, and individualistic social norms that render them independent and alone. Sin Padres, Ni Papeles illuminates how unaccompanied teens who grow up as undocumented low-wage workers navigate unthinkable material and emotional hardship, find the agency and hope that is required to survive, and discover what it means to be successful during the transition to adulthood in the United States.
ABOUT THE AUTHOR:
Stephanie L. Canizales, PhD, is a researcher, author, and professor currently appointed to the Department of Sociology at the University of California at Berkeley, and a Resident Scholar with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
Stephanie’s research specializations include international migration and immigrant integration; children, youth, and families; inequality, poverty, and mobility; and race and ethnicity. She uses in-depth interviews and ethnographic research methods to understand the causes of Latin American-origin migration to the U.S. and how immigrant children, youth, and families fare once there. Born and raised in Los Angeles, California, Stephanie is the daughter of Salvadoran immigrants whose experiences growing up as unaccompanied youth in Los Angeles inform her scholarship and motivate her commitment to public scholarship.

Cricket has reached the country of baseball and the performance of the home side, USA, will be a big factor in how popular the game gets in America. (More Cricket News)
USA alongside West Indies are co-hosts of the ICC Men's T20 World Cup that begins June 1.
The home side will be entering the prestigious tournament on the back of a confidence-boosting series win against Bangladesh, a Test playing nation. USA defeated Bangladesh in the first two games of the three-match T20I series and then lost the last match after resting their key players.
Led by Monank Patel, the co-hosts will depend heavily on few of their big names to carry them forward in the tournament. Stevan Taylor and Aaron Jones alongside skipper Patel are the big guns in batting while the bowling will be led by Ali Khan, whose exploits in the Caribbean Premier League helped him get picked by Kolkata Knight Riders in the 2020 IPL Auction.
The biggest star in the USA lineup will be without doubt Corey Anderson. The allrounder who once held the record for the fastest century in the history of ODI cricket will have the responsibility to add firepower to the American batting lineup.
USA In Group A
Playing a World Cup for the first time, USA have been placed in Group A with India, Pakistan, Ireland and Canada.

91,At Skylight Caitlin Schneiderhan Presents Medici Heist W Mackenzi Lee,"Join us as a sharp-witted teenage thief leads a team of skilled misfits in a dangerous and daring heist for fortune, freedom and revenge against a corrupt Pope in Renaissance Italy in Caitlin Schneiderhan's clever YA debut, Medici Heist.

Welcome to Florence, 1517, a world of intrigue and opulence, murder and betrayal. Seventeen-year-old conwoman Rosa Cellini arrives in the city the same day that the Medici Pope, Leo X, returns to take up the reins of power. This is not a coincidence. The new Pope is extorting a mountain of indulgence money from the people of Florence to bolster his power and standing, and Rosa has a plan to take it back.

To pull off the Renaissance’s greatest robbery, she’ll recruit a team of specially-chosen, highly-skilled misfits: Sarra the tinkerer, Khalid the fighter, and Giacomo, the irrepressible master of disguise. To top it all off, and to smooth their entrance into the fortress-like Palazzo Medici, Rosa even enlists the reluctant help of the famed artist Michelangelo.

But as the authorities draw closer and the Medici’s noose pulls tighter around the land, old secrets resurface and tensions in the group start to flare. What began as a robbery could be the key to saving the city itself—if Rosa and company don’t destroy each other first.
Caitlin Schneiderhan, author of Medici Heist, is a genre-loving writer on the hit Netflix show STRANGER THINGS. Originally hailing from Silver Spring, Maryland, Caitlin hatched from a cocoon of Terry Pratchett novels when she was 13. She spent her teenage years scribbling stories during class instead of paying attention (you can’t prove she wasn’t just taking notes). Eventually, she decided to chase that storytelling bug all the way out to sunny Los Angeles, where she spent a few years scribbling scripts at assistant jobs instead of paying attention (you can’t prove she wasn’t just taking notes). She has been named one of MovieMaker Magazine’s 25 Screenwriters to Watch, and has projects in development with multiple production companies around Hollywood.
Mackenzi Lee is the New York Times-bestselling author of ten books, including The Gentleman's Guide to Vice and Virtue. She currently lives in Los Angeles, where she manages an independent bookstore that is not Skylight, drinks too much diet coke, and caters to the whims of her human-sized dog.

On View March 9th through Fall 2024

Venice, California, is a place of real-life world-building, where locals imagine and reimagine their home over and again. The numerous and simultaneous versions of what the area has been—and what it may become—have themselves defined Venice ever since Abbot Kinney ventured to reconstruct Italy’s most serene city here on Pacific shores.

Also nominated for Best Picture, Story, and Film Editing, the score by Brian Easdale (Black Narcissus, Peeping Tom) and dazzling art direction from Hein Heckroth and Arthur Lawson both nabbed Oscars. Scorsese once called it “the film that plays in [his] heart,” and we promise its magic will linger long after leaving the theater.

About YOYOKA:
Born in Hokkaido, Japan, YOYOKA started playing drums even before she began to speak. When she was eight years old, she became the youngest weekly champion in the global drumming contest “Hit Like a Girl.” During this period, YOYOKA’s drum cover of Led Zeppelin’s “Good Times Bad Times” received international recognition and praise, including from Robert Plant himself.
YOYOKA became the youngest person to be featured on Drummerworld’s list of the world’s Top 500 Drummers and appeared in Newsweek Japan’s “100 Most Respected Japanese in the World.”
Her two appearances on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show,” along with commercials for companies like UNIQLO and Nike, have expanded her reach. Guest performances with many top artists including Fall Out Boy and Cyndi Lauper, as well as coverages by CNN, NBC, NPR, BBC, Billboard, Rolling Stone, etc., have further highlighted her talent.

About Ken Okada:
Bassist, composer, and arranger Noriyuki Ken Okada was born in New York and raised in São Paulo, Brazil, and Yokohama, Japan.

This joyous and poignant musical follows the life of the beloved Yiddish story-teller as he spins tales of his loves and losses, his fame and failures, his travels, travails and the tremendous optimism that kept him going against all odds. Based on his letters and tales, the controversy surrounding his stories and plays, and his passionate quest to honor the universality of the human spirit and celebrate our common humanity, he reminds us always that we have more in common than in conflict.
“I will never forget my evening with Sholom Aleichem and I thank you for bringing my cousin so beautifully back 'To Life'.” Lillian Aderman Moller
Playing to sold-out houses until the day before the lockdown, the delightful musical, back by audience request for a limited run, is written by the internationally acclaimed team of Chris DeCarlo and Evelyn Rudie, with lilting songs by Emery Bernauer, E. Rudie and Sholom Aleichem himself. Audiences are treated to an in-depth look at the joyous and poignant events that inspired the foolish philosophers, philosophical fools, comical shtetl folk and not-so-comical scoundrels that populated Sholom Aleichem's world.
“Chris DeCarlo has become the reincarnation of Sholom Aleichem” LASplash
The musical stars veteran performer Chris DeCarlo, who again assays the role of the beloved author, a characterization which has been enjoyed by more than a quarter of a million audience members, and Evelyn Rudie, who has created and portrayed more than three dozen Sholom Aleichem characters in over 2,000 performances to date.
“Evelyn Rudie is an all-around theatrical wizard!” Casting Call
Aleichem Sholom is presented by the Santa Monica Playhouse Jewish Heritage Project, supporting productions that keep the unique richness of Jewish theatre alive, honor the historical and cultural importance of Jewish heritage, and insure that new generations of theatre-goers appreciate and celebrate the life experience of Jewish ancestry, literature and tradition.
“ ‘Sholom Aleichem’ means ‘Hello, peace be with you.’ For Santa Monica Playhouse it means ‘richness in Jewish theatre for the community to enjoy.’ ” The Messenger
Santa Monica Playhouse is supported in part by grants from the City of Santa Monica and the Santa Monica Arts Commission, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors through the Los Angeles County Department of Arts and Culture, the Ahmanson Foundation, the Rotary Club Foundation and Playhouse PALS.

117,Honeymoon Suite With Apologies To Neil Simon,"There’s a subtitle to this show: “(with apologies to Neil Simon)”.There are certain obvious parallels to Honeymoon Suite and three of the late Simon’s plays: There are three couples, and each of them will experience pivotal moments in their relationship that will affect their marital destiny.
The stories in this show, however, are all new.
Evy and Oscar have eloped. One of them is a soldier who is about to be deployed. Evy and Oscar will have to cram a honeymoon into a severely restricted amount of time.
Mike is with his new (and second) wife Katie. Mike isn’t sure whether or not he had carnal relations with another woman at his bachelor party. It’s all a haze, now. Did he or didn’t he? The answer comes from an unexpected quarter.
Becca’s besties are there to console her, as it looks like Jeff jilted her at the altar. But is that what happened, really?
The cast includes Jerry Campisi, Whitney Montgomery, Chris Periko, Lilly Weak, Lindsay Shelton, Piper Major, Grace Neiswander, Pete Navis, Stevie Kincheloe, Lindsay Gentile, Erin Astin, and Alex Borja.

128,3B Collective Highway Hypnosis,"3B Collective: Highway Hypnosis explores the cultural lineage of 3B Collective, a group of native (and immigrant) Angeleno multidisciplinary artists. Presented at Craft Contemporary, the exhibition delves into past and present connections within the collective’s work, such as challenging preconceived notions of craft, the commodification of cultural goods, hyper-individualism, and hidden labor. All of these while honoring indigeneity and also shedding light on migration histories. The exhibition is a testament to collective effort, revealing the masterful hidden labor of artists and artisans who contribute to each work.
3B engages in collaborative works with skilled artisans from regions integral to their familial roots, such as Oaxaca, Jalisco, El Salvador,  and Baja California. This ongoing collaboration forms a contemporary manifestation of ancestral cultural networks within an urban context and sensibility in present-day America.
The exhibition features murals, assemblages, textiles, ceramics, mask installations, and other media that serve as vital expressions of a culture forced to migrate and adapt due to socio-political and financial pressures. The artworks embody a resilient cultural heritage that thrives and evolves across borders in a capitalist system that unintentionally makes them collaborators in their own exploitation.

The beloved Rudie-DeCarlo musical CINDERELLA is back for Aug-Sept only, to celebrate its 40th anniversary with a stunning multi-media makeove. It’s Cinderella like you’ve never seen her before, with new songs, hilarious special FX, a silent movie segment that will have you falling out of your seat, dazzling costumes, amazing magical prestidigitation, and a story about being true to your dreams and loving yourself as you are that's as meaningful today as ever before.
“A delight for the entire family!” LA SPLASH
It’s the perfect fairytale for today's generation: a handsome prince (who yearns to be loved for himself, not his royal position), silly stepsisters (who ultimately discover that looks really aren't everything), a feisty (but genuinely well-meaning) stepmother, a silver-foxy (if slightly befuddled) King and a refreshingly independent Cinderella.
""An Enchanting Cinderella!...highlighted by fast pacing, fancy costuming and a lovely, unweepy Cinderella…particularly within the context of Rudie and DeCarlo's trademark Gilbert & Sullivan comic lyrics."" LA Times
After two dozen tours to England, Alaska and Japan, CINDERELLA is still the single most requested Playhouse Musical Matinee on three continents and this delightful 40th anniversary make-over offers added delights: playful period costumes by award-winning designer Ashley Hayes, magical special effects by James Cooper and the heart-warming romance that blooms with the assistance of a glass slipper, a magic wand, and the audience's eager intervention.
""This extraordinary company creates a strange new brand of excitement...Truly imaginative and entertaining, this play has all its spark plugs firing."" - LA PARENT
CINDERELLA features Actors’ Repertory Theatre members James Cooper, Isabel Lindley, SummerAnne Love, J.T. Melagrano, Cydne Moore, Michala Peltz, Graham Silbert and Megan Wright, with special guest Olvia Hurtado as Cinderella. Fairygodmother, of course, plays herself. Directed by Playhouse Co-Artistic Director Chris DeCarlo, book, music & lyrics by DeCarlo and Evelyn Rudie.

This joyous and poignant musical follows the life of the beloved Yiddish story-teller as he spins tales of his loves and losses, his fame and failures, his travels, travails and the tremendous optimism that kept him going against all odds. Based on his letters and tales, the controversy surrounding his stories and plays, and his passionate quest to honor the universality of the human spirit and celebrate our common humanity, he reminds us always that we have more in common than in conflict.
“I will never forget my evening with Sholom Aleichem and I thank you for bringing my cousin so beautifully back 'To Life'.” Lillian Aderman Moller
Playing to sold-out houses until the day before the lockdown, the delightful musical, back by audience request for a limited run, is written by the internationally acclaimed team of Chris DeCarlo and Evelyn Rudie, with lilting songs by Emery Bernauer, E. Rudie and Sholom Aleichem himself. Audiences are treated to an in-depth look at the joyous and poignant events that inspired the foolish philosophers, philosophical fools, comical shtetl folk and not-so-comical scoundrels that populated Sholom Aleichem's world.
“Chris DeCarlo has become the reincarnation of Sholom Aleichem” LASplash
The musical stars veteran performer Chris DeCarlo, who again assays the role of the beloved author, a characterization which has been enjoyed by more than a quarter of a million audience members, and Evelyn Rudie, who has created and portrayed more than three dozen Sholom Aleichem characters in over 2,000 performances to date.
“Evelyn Rudie is an all-around theatrical wizard!” Casting Call
Aleichem Sholom is presented by the Santa Monica Playhouse Jewish Heritage Project, supporting productions that keep the unique richness of Jewish theatre alive, honor the historical and cultural importance of Jewish heritage, and insure that new generations of theatre-goers appreciate and celebrate the life experience of Jewish ancestry, literature and tradition.
“ ‘Sholom Aleichem’ means ‘Hello, peace be with you.’ For Santa Monica Playhouse it means ‘richness in Jewish theatre for the community to enjoy.’ ” The Messenger
Santa Monica Playhouse is supported in part by grants from the City of Santa Monica and the Santa Monica Arts Commission, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors through the Los Angeles County Department of Arts and Culture, the Ahmanson Foundation, the Rotary Club Foundation and Playhouse PALS.

Showcasing the rhythmic allure of Andalusian folk music, the Spanish-American conductor leads Falla’s evocative suite from The Three-Cornered Hat as well as Debussy’s poetic and provocative impression of the Iberian Peninsula. Distinguished Colburn graduate and violinist Blake Pouliot puts his spin on Piazzolla’s Argentine tango vision of Vivaldi’s Four Seasons. And as the grand finale unfolds, Flamenco Vivo Carlota Santana sashays to the steadfast snare of Ravel’s iconic Boléro, bringing forth the spirited ancestry and flair of traditional Spanish dance.

144,Beyond The Valley Of The Dolls In 35Mm,"Special guest: Introduction by actor John LaZar.
Released three years after the infamous Valley of the Dolls (1967), director Russ Meyer shows the excess of Hollywood and the rock ’n’ roll lifestyle of the late 1960s through a kaleidoscope of vibrant wardrobes, psychedelic music, skin, and violence. First conceived as a direct follow-up to its predecessor, then given to Meyer to be reworked as an over-the-top satirical take on the melodrama of the original, the film became a hit, doing very well at the box-office, unhindered by its original X rating. Though derided by many critics on its release, it has been the subject of critical reappraisal thanks to its cult following.
DIRECTED BY: Russ Meyer. WRITTEN BY: Roger Ebert. WITH: Dolly Read, Cynthia Myers, Marcia McBroom, John LaZar. 1970. 109 min. USA. Color. Scope. English.

145,All Rachmaninoff,"Born in 2001, Alexander Malofeev became known as the young “Russian genius” after winning the International Tchaikovsky Competition and rising to worldwide fame. Here he takes on the work of another “Russian genius,” performing Rachmaninoff’s Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini. Consisting of 24 variations of a popular violin tune, the concerto-like piece lets Malofeev “[lead] us, like a tornado, towards excess and madness” (Crescendo Magazine). Dima Slobodeniouk—an International Classical Music Award-winning conductor—makes his LA Phil debut in Rachmaninoff’s Second Symphony, guiding its gorgeous melodies that wander back and forth between heartrending slow movements, a brass-heavy scherzo, and a lively finale.",Aug 13,8:00PM - 10:00PM,Hollywood Bowl,$1.00 ,https://www.discoverlosangeles.com/event/2024/08/13/all-rachmaninoff

148,Honeymoon Suite With Apologies To Neil Simon,"There’s a subtitle to this show: “(with apologies to Neil Simon)”.There are certain obvious parallels to Honeymoon Suite and three of the late Simon’s plays: There are three couples, and each of them will experience pivotal moments in their relationship that will affect their marital destiny.
The stories in this show, however, are all new.
Evy and Oscar have eloped. One of them is a soldier who is about to be deployed. Evy and Oscar will have to cram a honeymoon into a severely restricted amount of time.
Mike is with his new (and second) wife Katie. Mike isn’t sure whether or not he had carnal relations with another woman at his bachelor party. It’s all a haze, now. Did he or didn’t he? The answer comes from an unexpected quarter.
Becca’s besties are there to console her, as it looks like Jeff jilted her at the altar. But is that what happened, really?
The cast includes Jerry Campisi, Whitney Montgomery, Chris Periko, Lilly Weak, Lindsay Shelton, Piper Major, Grace Neiswander, Pete Navis, Stevie Kincheloe, Lindsay Gentile, Erin Astin, and Alex Borja.

149,The Bauhaus Project,"Open Fist Theatre Company premieres The Bauhaus Project by Tom Jacobson, a world premiere theatrical event presented in two binge-worthy parts (Part 1: Bauhaus Weimer and Part 2: Bauhaus Dessau and Bauhaus Berlin) highlighting the rise of fascism and anti-Semitism in Germany and its effect on the arts. In this provocative play-within-a-play, five Southern California art students re-enact the history of the famous Bauhaus School, using their respective disciplines of environmental design, music, fine art, graphic design and theater to recreate the dramatic history in real time. Each of the students portrays multiple historic Bauhaus figures, many of whom later fled to the U.S. or died in concentration camps, including architect and Bauhaus founding director Walter Gropius and his successors, architects Hannes Meyer and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe; painters Paul Klee, Wassily Kandinsky, Oskar Schlemmer and Lyonel Feininger; textile artists Gunta Stolzl, Maria Kipp and Otti Berger; furniture designer Marcel Breuer; photographer Laszlo Moholy-Nagy; graphic designer Herbert Bayer; composers Arnold Schönberg and Alma Mahler; and architects Ludwig Hilberseimer and Fritz Ertl — the latter of whom would go on to design buildings at Auschwitz.
Part I, which focuses on the school’s founding and early years in the city of Weimar, will run Fridays at 8 p.m. and Saturdays at 4 p.m., while Part 2, which looks at the school’s moves, first to Dessau, then to Berlin, in the face of increasing Nazi scrutiny, will play on Saturdays at 8 p.m. and Sundays at 4 p.m. Audience members can choose to view the entire Bauhaus Project over the course of two evenings (any Friday and any Saturday at 8 p.m.); two matinees (any Saturday and any Sunday at 4 p.m.); or on a single Saturday, at 4 p.m. and 8 p.m. (The history is sequential, so it is not advised to view the parts out of order.)

162,Guy J Jackson Discusses Itll Be Fun Youll See A Short Story Collection,"Yeah, so, no one's really precisely sure what to make of all this. The promotional blurbs here and herein are from people more eloquent than this person right now writing this, so the blurbs are actually where you want to look for an approximate spin on this book's supposed contents, a supposed collection of supposed short stories. But is it really a collection, per se...? Are they really short stories...? A.F. Harrold once pointed out that technically speaking the ""short stories"" of Guy J. Jackson aren't always quantifiable as ""short stories"", and sometimes they are just ""things"". Whereas Gwyneth Herbert, if we recall semi-correctly, once advised to simply drink Jackson's ""stories"" out of a diamond-studded high heel with someone you prefer while lingering in lucidity on a country road at dusk. But at least it's been firmly postulated, by experts the world over, that if one consumes these so-called ""short stories"" of Jackson's at the rate of one ""story"" per day, with skipped days being acceptable, one will feel infinitesimally better about, and ever-so-slightly more able to handle, the fundamental inanities of living Life itself.

Guy J. Jackson is a would-be moviemaker currently dwelling in Los Angeles, though his essence can also be found on YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram.

164,The Double V,"International City Theatre presents a historical drama about the first Black civil rights movement in the U.S. In 1942, his attempt to enlist in the army rejected because of his color, 26-year-old James G. Thompson of Wichita, Kansas wrote a letter to the editor of The Pittsburgh Courier, at the time the most highly circulated Black newspaper with a readership of over 350,000. “Should I sacrifice my life to live half American?” he asked… leading the Courier to kick off the “Double V” campaign. Building on the popular “V for Victory” slogan that called for triumph in the war, the super-imposed, second “V” called for victory in the fight for racial equality — in the army, the navy, and in all aspects of segregated daily life. Other Black newspapers, including the Chicago Defender and the Amsterdam Star-News, soon took up the call. Under pressure from the campaign, and against the advice of J. Edgar Hoover’s FBI, the U.S. was forced to adopt a policy of “proportional representation” that allowed Black Americans to participate in the military in direct proportion to their percentage of the population.

165,Miracle Mile In 35Mm,"Guest speaker: Introduction by musician and composer Paul Haslinger.
Harry (Anthony Edwards) and Julie (Mare Winningham) have a romantic encounter at the La Brea Tar Pits and quickly fall in love. Harry’s bliss is short-lived when he answers a ringing payphone and hears a frantic warning that nuclear missiles are heading toward his location. Distraught by the thought of never seeing Julie again, he does whatever he can to find her while warning others along the way, unsure whether he is sparking citywide panic unnecessarily. Filmed on location along Wilshire Boulevard, inside LA landmark Johnie’s Coffee Shop, and featuring the May Company Building that would become the Academy Museum, Miracle Mile sees the city descend into chaos in the face of impending doom.

166,Cinderella %E2%80%93 An %E2%80%9Cenchanting%E2%80%9D Rudie Decarlo Family Theatre Musical For Kids 2 To,"“Pick of the Month!” Show Time Magazine.
The beloved Rudie-DeCarlo musical CINDERELLA is back for Aug-Sept only, to celebrate its 40th anniversary with a stunning multi-media makeove. It’s Cinderella like you’ve never seen her before, with new songs, hilarious special FX, a silent movie segment that will have you falling out of your seat, dazzling costumes, amazing magical prestidigitation, and a story about being true to your dreams and loving yourself as you are that's as meaningful today as ever before.
“A delight for the entire family!” LA SPLASH
It’s the perfect fairytale for today's generation: a handsome prince (who yearns to be loved for himself, not his royal position), silly stepsisters (who ultimately discover that looks really aren't everything), a feisty (but genuinely well-meaning) stepmother, a silver-foxy (if slightly befuddled) King and a refreshingly independent Cinderella.
""An Enchanting Cinderella!...highlighted by fast pacing, fancy costuming and a lovely, unweepy Cinderella…particularly within the context of Rudie and DeCarlo's trademark Gilbert & Sullivan comic lyrics."" LA Times
After two dozen tours to England, Alaska and Japan, CINDERELLA is still the single most requested Playhouse Musical Matinee on three continents and this delightful 40th anniversary make-over offers added delights: playful period costumes by award-winning designer Ashley Hayes, magical special effects by James Cooper and the heart-warming romance that blooms with the assistance of a glass slipper, a magic wand, and the audience's eager intervention.
""This extraordinary company creates a strange new brand of excitement...Truly imaginative and entertaining, this play has all its spark plugs firing."" - LA PARENT
CINDERELLA features Actors’ Repertory Theatre members James Cooper, Isabel Lindley, SummerAnne Love, J.T. Melagrano, Cydne Moore, Michala Peltz, Graham Silbert and Megan Wright, with special guest Olvia Hurtado as Cinderella. Fairygodmother, of course, plays herself. Directed by Playhouse Co-Artistic Director Chris DeCarlo, book, music & lyrics by DeCarlo and Evelyn Rudie.
Splendid birthday parties, hosted by costumed members of the Cinderella Company, are available with every performance.

184,Ismet Prcic In Conversation With Michelle Latiolais Discusses Unspeakable Home,"A stunningly original, stylistically brilliant, and brutally honest novel from an award-winning Bosnian refugee and writer who, decades after escaping his war-torn home country looks back on his childhood, imploded relationships, and battles with addiction--offering powerful insight into the human cost of conflict.
It's been two years since our narrator divorced his beloved and lost his safest and most adoring home when he fled Bosnia as a teenager. The marriage couldn't survive his brokenness, the trauma so entrenched and insidious that it became impossible to communicate to anyone outside of himself--even the person he loved most. But, as he writes in the first of many courageously candid fan letters to the comedian Bill Burr, he knows he must try.
A linguistically adventurous, structurally ambitious, and emotionally brave odyssey, Unspeakable Home takes us through the memories and confessions of our refugee narrator as he reflects on his bomb-ravaged childhood, the implosion of his relationships, and an agonizing battle with alcoholism. As multiple narrators surface in fragments with increasingly tenuous connections to reality, Prcic unearths the psychological cost of exile and shame with a roving, kinetic energy and a sharp, searching sense of humor. What emerges is a vivid and poignant exploration of the stories we create to hide the deepest parts of our identity from ourselves, as well as a hard-won, life-affirming promise of redemption.",Aug 6,7:00PM - 9:00PM,Book Soup,,https://www.discoverlosangeles.com/event/2024/08/06/ismet-prcic-in-conversation-with-michelle-latiolais-discusses-unspeakable-home
185,Guy Trebay In Conversation With Lisa Birnbach Discusses Do Something Coming Of Age,"An evocative coming-of-age memoir—the story of the education of a wayward wild child and acidhead who, searching for meaning and purpose, found refuge in the demimonde of the ruined but magical metropolis that was New York City in the 1970s.

Born in the Bronx, Guy Trebay was raised in an atmosphere of privilege on Long Island’s North Shore after his entrepreneurial father struck business gold with Hawaiian Surf, a wildly successful cologne company that capitalized on the optimism of the 1960s as marketed to “an adventurous new breed of men.’’ But behind the facade of material prosperity lay the emotional disarray of a household dominated by a charismatic, con artist father, a glamorous yet lost and careless mother, a family haunted by tragedy. By the time Trebay established a foothold at the fringes of Andy Warhol’s Factory and the diverse artistic tribes that thrived in Manhattan in that pre-digital era, his father had lost his fortune, his younger sister had been arrested for armed robbery and fled underground, the family house was in ashes, and his mother was dead.

Unschooled and on his own, Trebay became a striver, wending his way through a seemingly apocalyptic landscape populated by a vibrant cast of characters, including washed-up Hollywood screenwriters of the ’30s; Warhol superstars like Jackie Curtis and Candy Darling; fashion geniuses like Charles James; and emerging artists, filmmakers, writers, designers, photographers, and deejays who would powerfully influence mainstream culture in the decades to come.
Lisa Birnbach is an editor and writer of The Official Preppy Handbook, writer of True Prep, award-winning broadcaster, and recovering podcaster. She writes book reviews for The Washington Post and is trying to figure out the fastest way to get from Griffith Park to Zabar's.",Aug 12,7:00PM - 9:00PM,Book Soup,,https://www.discoverlosangeles.com/event/2024/08/12/guy-trebay-in-conversation-with-lisa-birnbach-discusses-do-something-coming-of-age

Synopsis
Maritza Plunck, a charming Vice President at Banco Popovaire in New York, declares that these days it’s the “Buh buh buh of billions, not the muh muh muh of millions that sets wedding bells to ding dong dang.” She will only marry a billionaire. When she hires a temp, Tad, for the week, she has no idea she is harboring the fugitive CEO, Lad Tusselhof, who built his company in a Chicago garage to a trillion dollars in just three months. Lad was famous for working so fast that photographs of him always came out as a blur. Nobody knows what he looks like. 
His quest to regain his trillion dollars starts with hacking into Maritza's computer and bumping her salary up to 365 million dollars a year – throwing multitudes out of work, destroying countless lives in a matter of seconds. Maritza accepts the money reluctantly, turning a blind eye to its provenance. Will a Drug Cartel Gang, attempted human sacrifice, and a double shotgun wedding at an ancient Maya temple deep in the jungle lead to marital bliss?

193,Gary Clark Jr,"Gary Clark Jr.’s abilities to seamlessly blend blues, rock, and R&B has made him a modern-day icon—and four-time Grammy winner. On his new album, JPEG RAW, he widens the scope even more. The singer and guitarist draws inspiration from blues singer Sonny Boy Williamson and jazz pianist Thelonious Monk. He’s bringing together flourishes from African music with jazz and other sounds from around the world. And he’s got a lot to say, not just singing but rapping and delivering his socially conscious and deeply personal lyrics in spoken word—all atop groove-oriented psychedelia with hip-hop beats, anthemic choruses, and fuzz guitar.
Trailblazing husband-and-wife duo Michael Trotter Jr. and Tanya Trotter expand their borders with their intimate songwriting. Combining blues, soul, R&B, gospel, country, and more, they dig into into the lessons their love has taught them, bringing it all to bear with a revival-like intensity that’s made their live shows can’t-miss events around the world.",Aug 21,8:00PM - 10:00PM,Hollywood Bowl,$10.00 ,https://www.discoverlosangeles.com/event/2024/08/21/gary-clark-jr

207,Herbie Hancock,"In 1973, Herbie Hancock wanted to create something new—something lighter, funkier: something you could dance to. “There was this need to take some more of the earth and to feel a little more tethered,” he’s said. Taking a few musical cues from Sly & The Family Stone, Curtis Mayfield, and The Pointer Sisters, Herbie rounded up drummer Harvey Mason, saxophonist Bennie Maupin, percussionist Bill Summers, and bassist Paul Jackson, and he got to work.
The album they made together, Head Hunters, wasn’t just one of the best albums of Herbie’s career—it’s one of the greatest albums of all time, according to Rolling Stone. It was a smash hit, becoming one of the best-selling jazz albums in history. By bringing a funk sensibility to jazz, Herbie and the Headhunters, as they christened themselves, turned jazz into a pop phenomenon, serving up their marvelously complex rhythm experiments in an easy-to-understand package. The album’s styling and groove made it an immediate dance-floor favorite; hip-hop producers have been mining Head Hunters for samples ever since.
Now, fifty years later, Herbie reunites with all of the original players from the Head Hunters recording for the first time since 1973: Harvey Mason, Bennie Maupin, and Bill Summers, plus bassist Marcus Miller, who fills in for the late Paul Jackson. This will be the band’s only appearance, so don’t miss your chance to experience one of the greatest groups in jazz history.",Aug 14,8:00PM - 10:00PM,Hollywood Bowl,$10.00 ,https://www.discoverlosangeles.com/event/2024/08/14/herbie-hancock

Synopsis
Maritza Plunck, a charming Vice President at Banco Popovaire in New York, declares that these days it’s the “Buh buh buh of billions, not the muh muh muh of millions that sets wedding bells to ding dong dang.” She will only marry a billionaire. When she hires a temp, Tad, for the week, she has no idea she is harboring the fugitive CEO, Lad Tusselhof, who built his company in a Chicago garage to a trillion dollars in just three months. Lad was famous for working so fast that photographs of him always came out as a blur. Nobody knows what he looks like. 
His quest to regain his trillion dollars starts with hacking into Maritza's computer and bumping her salary up to 365 million dollars a year – throwing multitudes out of work, destroying countless lives in a matter of seconds. Maritza accepts the money reluctantly, turning a blind eye to its provenance. Will a Drug Cartel Gang, attempted human sacrifice, and a double shotgun wedding at an ancient Maya temple deep in the jungle lead to marital bliss?

224,The Tales Of Hoffmann In 4K,"The very definition of magnificence, The Tales of Hoffmann is a groundbreaking creation of a new art form, painstakingly orchestrating the juxtaposition of two mediums: film and opera. Consisting of music conducted by Sir Thomas Beecham with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra—which motivates fluidity in the stunning choreography between performers, cinematography, and storytelling—this innovative feature is an adaptation of Jacques Offenbach’s 1881 opera of the same name, based on three of E. T. A. Hoffmann’s heartbreaking love stories. Each tale is presented in a different thematic color (yellow, red, and blue), realized through the Oscar-nominated art direction and costume designs of Hein Heckroth.
DIRECTED/WRITTEN BY: Michael Powell, Emeric Pressburger. WITH: Moira Shearer, Ludmilla Tchérina, Ann Ayars, Robert Rounseville. 1951. 128 min. UK. Technicolor. English. 4K DCP.

225,Honeymoon Suite With Apologies To Neil Simon,"There’s a subtitle to this show: “(with apologies to Neil Simon)”.There are certain obvious parallels to Honeymoon Suite and three of the late Simon’s plays: There are three couples, and each of them will experience pivotal moments in their relationship that will affect their marital destiny.
The stories in this show, however, are all new.
Evy and Oscar have eloped. One of them is a soldier who is about to be deployed. Evy and Oscar will have to cram a honeymoon into a severely restricted amount of time.
Mike is with his new (and second) wife Katie. Mike isn’t sure whether or not he had carnal relations with another woman at his bachelor party. It’s all a haze, now. Did he or didn’t he? The answer comes from an unexpected quarter.
Becca’s besties are there to console her, as it looks like Jeff jilted her at the altar. But is that what happened, really?
The cast includes Jerry Campisi, Whitney Montgomery, Chris Periko, Lilly Weak, Lindsay Shelton, Piper Major, Grace Neiswander, Pete Navis, Stevie Kincheloe, Lindsay Gentile, Erin Astin, and Alex Borja.

227,Perfect Love,"In French with English subtitles.
Catherine Breillat traces the shockingly violent disintegration of a May-December affair in PERFECT LOVE, arguably her most realistic and disturbing study of romance gone wrong. When twice-divorced optician Frédérique (Isabelle Renauld) falls for the much younger Christophe (Francis Renaud), whose insecurity is matched only by his unconscious need for manipulation and control, she eventually becomes addicted to their toxic relationship. Once more demonstrating a superlative ear for dialogue and a preternatural ability to elicit thunderous performances, Breillat delves into the psychological roots and consequences of codependency with the unflinching courage that has become her trademark.

228,49 Winchester With Kelsey Waldon,"With its latest album, “Fortune Favors The Bold,” Russell County, Virginia-based 49 Winchester is ready and roaring to break onto the national scene with its unique brand of tear-in-your-beer alt-country, sticky barroom floor rock-n-roll, and high-octane Appalachian folk.
“As we’ve aged and matured, our sound has gone from a softer place to this grittier, edgier tone that we have now,” says lead singer/guitarist Isaac Gibson. “So, we’re trending more towards being a rock band instead of a country band. But, at the same time, I don’t think anybody’s ever known quite what to call it.”
Although it’s 49 Winchester’s fourth studio album, “Fortune Favors The Bold” marks its debut for Nashville’s New West Records — one of the premier labels for Americana, indie and rock acts on the cutting edge of sound, scope and spectacle.
Formed eight years ago on Winchester Street in the small mountain town of Castlewood, Virginia (population: 2,045), the band started as a rag tag bunch of neighborhood teenagers who just wanted to get together for the sake of playing together.",Aug 5,8:00PM - 10:00PM,El Rey Theatre,$35 ,https://www.discoverlosangeles.com/event/2024/08/05/49-winchester-with-kelsey-waldon

231,Cinderella %E2%80%93 An %E2%80%9Cenchanting%E2%80%9D Rudie Decarlo Family Theatre Musical For Kids 2 To,"“Pick of the Month!” Show Time Magazine.
The beloved Rudie-DeCarlo musical CINDERELLA is back for Aug-Sept only, to celebrate its 40th anniversary with a stunning multi-media makeove. It’s Cinderella like you’ve never seen her before, with new songs, hilarious special FX, a silent movie segment that will have you falling out of your seat, dazzling costumes, amazing magical prestidigitation, and a story about being true to your dreams and loving yourself as you are that's as meaningful today as ever before.
“A delight for the entire family!” LA SPLASH
It’s the perfect fairytale for today's generation: a handsome prince (who yearns to be loved for himself, not his royal position), silly stepsisters (who ultimately discover that looks really aren't everything), a feisty (but genuinely well-meaning) stepmother, a silver-foxy (if slightly befuddled) King and a refreshingly independent Cinderella.
""An Enchanting Cinderella!...highlighted by fast pacing, fancy costuming and a lovely, unweepy Cinderella…particularly within the context of Rudie and DeCarlo's trademark Gilbert & Sullivan comic lyrics."" LA Times
After two dozen tours to England, Alaska and Japan, CINDERELLA is still the single most requested Playhouse Musical Matinee on three continents and this delightful 40th anniversary make-over offers added delights: playful period costumes by award-winning designer Ashley Hayes, magical special effects by James Cooper and the heart-warming romance that blooms with the assistance of a glass slipper, a magic wand, and the audience's eager intervention.
""This extraordinary company creates a strange new brand of excitement...Truly imaginative and entertaining, this play has all its spark plugs firing."" - LA PARENT
CINDERELLA features Actors’ Repertory Theatre members James Cooper, Isabel Lindley, SummerAnne Love, J.T. Melagrano, Cydne Moore, Michala Peltz, Graham Silbert and Megan Wright, with special guest Olvia Hurtado as Cinderella. Fairygodmother, of course, plays herself. Directed by Playhouse Co-Artistic Director Chris DeCarlo, book, music & lyrics by DeCarlo and Evelyn Rudie.
Splendid birthday parties, hosted by costumed members of the Cinderella Company, are available with every performance.

Cricket has reached the country of baseball and the performance of the home side, USA, will be a big factor in how popular the game gets in America. (More Cricket News)
USA alongside West Indies are co-hosts of the ICC Men's T20 World Cup that begins June 1.
The home side will be entering the prestigious tournament on the back of a confidence-boosting series win against Bangladesh, a Test playing nation. USA defeated Bangladesh in the first two games of the three-match T20I series and then lost the last match after resting their key players.
Led by Monank Patel, the co-hosts will depend heavily on few of their big names to carry them forward in the tournament. Stevan Taylor and Aaron Jones alongside skipper Patel are the big guns in batting while the bowling will be led by Ali Khan, whose exploits in the Caribbean Premier League helped him get picked by Kolkata Knight Riders in the 2020 IPL Auction.
The biggest star in the USA lineup will be without doubt Corey Anderson. The allrounder who once held the record for the fastest century in the history of ODI cricket will have the responsibility to add firepower to the American batting lineup.

234,Flipside,"Summer Night Cinema is made possible by Carla Emil and Rich Silverstein.
In person: director Chris Wilcha
When filmmaker Chris Wilcha revisits the record store he worked at as a teenager in New Jersey, he finds the once-thriving bastion of music and weirdness from his youth slowly falling apart and out of touch with the times. Flipside documents his tragicomic attempt to revive the store while revisiting other documentary projects he has abandoned over the years. In the process, Wilcha captures This American Life icon Ira Glass in the midst of a creative rebirth, discovers the origin story of David Bowie’s ode to a local New Jersey cable television hero, and uncovers the unlikely connection between jazz photographer Herman Leonard and TV writer David Milch. This disparate collection of stories coheres into something strange and expansive—a moving meditation on music, work, and the sacrifices and satisfaction of trying to live a creative life.",Aug 6,7:30PM - 9:30PM,Hammer Museum,,https://www.discoverlosangeles.com/event/2024/08/06/flipside

It’s Not You
It’s not always easy to tell when you’re dealing with a narcissist. One day they draw you in with their confidence and charisma, the next they gaslight you, wreck your self-confidence, and leave you wondering, What could I have done differently?
As Dr. Ramani Durvasula reveals in It's Not You, the answer is: absolutely nothing. Just as a tiger can’t change its stripes, a narcissist won’t stop manipulating and invalidating you. To heal in the aftermath of their abuse and protect yourself from future harm, you first have to accept that you are not to blame.
Healing and thriving after or even during a narcissistic relationship can be challenging, but it is possible. It's Not You shows that the first step is to stop trying to change the narcissistic person, stop blaming yourself, and start giving yourself permission to foster your autonomy and sense of self outside of this relationship.
To Be Loved
Rarely does a trauma therapist disclose their own trauma history...yet it's the untold, brutally honest, incredibly heartbreaking story of Dr. Frank Anderson that made him the world-renowned trauma expert he is today.
Known for his magnetic and radiant personality, Frank spends his time training thousands of clinicians around the world on how to help clients with complex trauma make sense of their suffering. But underneath this charismatic exterior are his dark family secrets, including the marks of child abuse from his father and the invisible scars of shame.
In To Be Loved, Frank shares his confusing experience of growing up an outsider in a typical Midwestern Italian American home that was at one turn fiercely loving, but at the same time unaccepting, abusive, and rife with secrets.
After enduring six years of therapy as a child in the 1970s, he was programmed to be something that he wasn't for decades, and became driven to create the perfect life—until it all fell apart.
It was only then that he realized resilience, forgiveness, and facing his trauma were the keys to living an authentic life—and finally knowing what it feels like to be loved.
 Ramani Durvasula, Ph.D. is a licensed clinical psychologist in California, the founder and CEO of LUNA Education, Training and Consulting, and professor emerita of psychology at California State University Los Angeles. She is the New York Times Bestselling Author of It’s Not You: Identifying and Healing from Narcissistic People. She is also the author of multiple other books including “Don’t You Know Who I Am”: How to Stay Sane in the Era of Narcissism, Entitlement and Incivility and Should I Stay or Should I Go: Surviving a Relationship With a Narcissist. She has lectured and trained therapists around the world on best practices on working with clients experiencing narcissistic abuse and has developed a 36 hour virtual training and certification program in conjunction with PESI to train clinicians on how to use an Antagonism-Informed approach with clients experiencing narcissistic relationships. Dr. Durvasula hosts a popular YouTube channel with over 1.6 million subscribers, hosted the critically acclaimed podcast Navigating Narcissism, and is a featured expert on the digital media platform MedCircle. She has also been widely involved in the governance of the American Psychological Association, including the APA Leadership Institute for Women in Psychology and the APA Minority Fellowship Program.   Dr. Durvasula received her M.A., and Ph.D. degrees in clinical psychology from UCLA, and completed her internship and post-doctoral training at the UCLA Neuropsychiatric Institute. She completed her Bachelor of Science Degree in Psychology, with a minor in sociology in 1988 at the University of Connecticut.   She resides in Los Angeles, CA.
Frank Anderson, MD, is a world-renowned trauma treatment expert, Harvard-trained psychiatrist, and psychotherapist. He is the acclaimed author of Transcending Trauma, upcoming memoir, To Be Loved: A Story of Truth, Trauma, and Transformation, and the coauthor of Internal Family Systems Skills Training Manual. As a global speaker on the treatment of trauma and dissociation, he is passionate about teaching brain-based psychotherapy and integrating current neuroscience knowledge with the Internal Family Systems (IFS) model of therapy. Dr. Anderson believes that traumatic events can have a lasting effect on the well-being and life of an individual and that addressing these events will help lead people down a pathway of healing and forgiveness.  
Dr. Anderson is the co-founder of The Trauma Institute and Trauma Informed Media, organizations that promote trauma awareness, education, integration, and healing. He is a lead trainer at the IFS Institute under Richard Schwartz and has a long affiliation with Bessel van der Kolk and the Trauma Research Foundation. Dr. Anderson maintains a private practice in Harvard, MA, where he lives with his husband and 2 sons.

259,Dimensions Of Sound In Movies Scoring,"Tune in to the sounds of film scoring and soundtracking in this workshop designed for theater-goers ages 15 and up.
Film scores and soundtracks not only heighten the emotion of a film, but they can also help us better understand the worlds and characters we see on screen. Film composers write music to enhance the emotion of a scene and draw us in, and music supervisors compile the songs in a soundtrack to connect us to a film, a character, or a world.
This workshop will consider: what is the difference between a score and a soundtrack? How does a score heighten the emotion of a scene? How do music composers and sound designers work together?
In this music-focused session, we will focus on scoring, soundtracking, and the musical layers of film. We will listen to a variety of scores and aesthetics to understand the emotional impact that music has on a film, and then design our own “temp” music for a variety of scenes.",Aug 10,3:00PM - 4:00PM,Academy Museum of Motion Pictures,,https://www.discoverlosangeles.com/event/2024/08/10/dimensions-of-sound-in-movies-scoring

Shot over several years in a handheld, vérité style by celebrated documentary filmmaker Haskell Wexler, Oscar-nominated cinematographer Jack Couffer, and notable street photographer Helen Levitt, viewers lurk alongside freshly-divorced Judith (Barbara Baxley) as she sleepwalks into dive bars, burlesque clubs, and dubious religious congregations for one of the most ominous visions of a mid-century Los Angeles underbelly ever committed to film.

270,Woven Narratives,"Embark on a journey where art becomes the storyteller at Woven Narratives, Artplex Gallery's latest exhibition. This captivating showcase invites patrons to delve into the intricate threads of imagination, where every brushstroke and stitch unveils a tale waiting to be unraveled. From the vibrant tapestries of award-winning textile artist Nilraya Bundasak to the surreal narratives of self-taught painter Jeff Faust, Woven Narratives promises to enchant and inspire, offering a glimpse into the boundless creativity that thrives within the walls of Artplex Gallery. Join us as we explore the power of art to enchant hearts and minds, weaving stories that transcend time and space.
Visionary textile artist Nilraya Bundasak was born in the vibrant landscapes of Khon Kaen, Thailand, in 1992. Bundasak's passion for textile artistry blossomed at Sipakorn University, where she honed her craft, eventually establishing her studio oasis in the bustling heart of Bangkok. Her illustrious career boasts a string of accolades, including the esteemed Young Artists Talent Award and multiple triumphs at the White Elephant Art Awards, underscoring her prowess in the realm of large-scale embroidery.
Drawing inspiration from the kaleidoscopic world of contemporary fashion, Bundasak's creations are a symphony of color and texture, breathing new life into repurposed materials through intricate embroidery. Each piece is a homage to individuality, celebrating the transformative power of adornment and the emotional tapestry of femininity. With a keen eye for evolving trends and a steadfast commitment to sustainability, Bundasak's work is not just a reflection of fashion's evolution but also a testament to the beauty of conscious consumption.
In California, the enigmatic painter Jeff Faust weaves his own narrative through the canvas. A lifelong devotee to the arts, Faust's journey began in childhood and has since evolved into a testament to the power of self-discovery. Eschewing formal education, Faust charted his course guided by a singular vision: simplicity.
Infused with elements of surrealism and poetic symbolism, Faust's canvases transport viewers into a realm where clouds dance with ropes, and leaves cradle enigmatic eggs, each stroke hinting at untold stories. His creative process is a dance between chaos and control, as he surrenders to the canvas's whims, allowing each composition to unfold organically.
Despite the complexity of his creations, Faust's heart beats for the simplicity found in everyday marvels—a bird with a twig, a bowl of leaves—each whispering secrets of the universe. Through his acrylic masterpieces, Faust invites viewers to pause, to breathe, and to rediscover the beauty in life's quiet moments.

308,Matthew Kennedy Discusses On Elizabeth Taylor An Opinionated Guide,"In the oceans of ink devoted to the monumental movie star / businesswoman / AIDS political activist Elizabeth Rosemond Taylor (1932-2011), her beauty and celebrity frequently overshadowed her films. In film historian Matthew Kennedy's On Elizabeth Taylor: An Opinionated Guide, her storied life is secondary to Elizabeth Taylor, the actress. Each of her 67 feature films and television movies over her 50 year career are reviewed here. Included are essays on her legendary hits, including National Velvet (1944), A Place in the Sun (1951), Giant (1956), Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958), Suddenly, Last Summer (1959), and Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966). But equal time is given to everything from the misunderstood Cleopatra (1963), to the underrated The Driver's Seat (1974), the maligned BUtterfield 8 (1960), the curious Hammersmith is Out (1972), and mostly forgotten entries such as Cynthia (1947) and The Big Hangover (1950) from her early years at MGM. The result is an admiring but not idolatrous career biography of a monumental Hollywood star, one of the biggest ever, who brought unparalleled magnetism to the screen.

309,Harrison Gilman Live Painting,"Artspace Warehouse is thrilled to announce an upcoming live painting event featuring the talented and dynamic artist, Harrison Gilman. The event will take place on August 4th, 2:00-4:00 PM, offering art enthusiasts a unique opportunity to witness Gilman’s creative process in real-time.
Harrison Gilman, a Los Angeles-based artist, has quickly made a name for himself in the art world. A graduate of NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts with a BFA in Filmmaking and minors in Art History and the Business of Media, Gilman’s artistic journey began during his film studies. His passion for painting blossomed during his time at NYU, leading him to commit fully to the craft upon graduation.
Gilman’s work first captured attention at the 2018 We Rise Art Fair in Los Angeles, where he showcased alongside renowned artists like Shepard Fairey. This initial exposure paved the way for his first solo show at Galerie Tangerine in Nashville, TN, in 2019. Since then, Gilman has exhibited in numerous solo and group shows, as well as participated in a series of live painting events that have captivated audiences.
Speaking about his artwork, Gilman explains, “[My paintings] are landscapes and portraits of my subconscious. Visual representations of my subatomic particles, my dark matter. I paint because it helps me see these things buried beneath the surface of my mind. It’s so easy to get caught up in the material world and all the distractions and what we think we’re feeling and what we should be feeling versus whatever is actually going on . . . Painting takes me back to the source. My paintings are manifestations of myself, my experiences, sensations, and basically every little thing. They’re more accurate than a mirror.”
Don’t miss this exclusive opportunity to witness Harrison Gilman’s live painting event at Artspace Warehouse Los Angeles. Join us for an afternoon of creativity, inspiration, and a unique glimpse into the mind of one of LA’s most compelling contemporary artists.

The beloved Rudie-DeCarlo musical CINDERELLA is back for Aug-Sept only, to celebrate its 40th anniversary with a stunning multi-media makeove. It’s Cinderella like you’ve never seen her before, with new songs, hilarious special FX, a silent movie segment that will have you falling out of your seat, dazzling costumes, amazing magical prestidigitation, and a story about being true to your dreams and loving yourself as you are that's as meaningful today as ever before.
“A delight for the entire family!” LA SPLASH
It’s the perfect fairytale for today's generation: a handsome prince (who yearns to be loved for himself, not his royal position), silly stepsisters (who ultimately discover that looks really aren't everything), a feisty (but genuinely well-meaning) stepmother, a silver-foxy (if slightly befuddled) King and a refreshingly independent Cinderella.
""An Enchanting Cinderella!...highlighted by fast pacing, fancy costuming and a lovely, unweepy Cinderella…particularly within the context of Rudie and DeCarlo's trademark Gilbert & Sullivan comic lyrics."" LA Times
After two dozen tours to England, Alaska and Japan, CINDERELLA is still the single most requested Playhouse Musical Matinee on three continents and this delightful 40th anniversary make-over offers added delights: playful period costumes by award-winning designer Ashley Hayes, magical special effects by James Cooper and the heart-warming romance that blooms with the assistance of a glass slipper, a magic wand, and the audience's eager intervention.
""This extraordinary company creates a strange new brand of excitement...Truly imaginative and entertaining, this play has all its spark plugs firing."" - LA PARENT
CINDERELLA features Actors’ Repertory Theatre members James Cooper, Isabel Lindley, SummerAnne Love, J.T. Melagrano, Cydne Moore, Michala Peltz, Graham Silbert and Megan Wright, with special guest Olvia Hurtado as Cinderella. Fairygodmother, of course, plays herself. Directed by Playhouse Co-Artistic Director Chris DeCarlo, book, music & lyrics by DeCarlo and Evelyn Rudie.
Splendid birthday parties, hosted by costumed members of the Cinderella Company, are available with every performance.

324,Honeymoon Suite With Apologies To Neil Simon,"There’s a subtitle to this show: “(with apologies to Neil Simon)”.There are certain obvious parallels to Honeymoon Suite and three of the late Simon’s plays: There are three couples, and each of them will experience pivotal moments in their relationship that will affect their marital destiny.
The stories in this show, however, are all new.
Evy and Oscar have eloped. One of them is a soldier who is about to be deployed. Evy and Oscar will have to cram a honeymoon into a severely restricted amount of time.
Mike is with his new (and second) wife Katie. Mike isn’t sure whether or not he had carnal relations with another woman at his bachelor party. It’s all a haze, now. Did he or didn’t he? The answer comes from an unexpected quarter.
Becca’s besties are there to console her, as it looks like Jeff jilted her at the altar. But is that what happened, really?

326,Awaken Now Acupuncture And Wellness Center,"Have you ever thought of acupuncture as a weapon against aging? “This age-old healing practice is now becoming the new trend in natural facelifts,” says Dr. Marina Dabcevic, a registered acupuncturist with a Doctorate in Oriental Medicine and Acupuncture. Beauty gurus and wellness advocates are seeking non-invasive
alternatives to achieve their desired look and many are turning to Cosmetic or Facial Acupuncture. This non-toxic alternative to Botox encompasses an inner and outer wellness experience with many benefits and is now available at Awaken Now.
  It won't work overnight. This is a specific 10 session protocol that is performed twice per week for 5 weeks. The reason being the dermis takes 4-5 weeks to regenerate. We need to continuously stimulate the dermis with micro-traumas caused by the hair-thin needles to build collagen and elastin to create long-lasting results. The best part... Dr. Marina recommends getting the 10 session Cosmetic Acupuncture protocol once every 2-5 years, if monthly facials are scheduled for regular maintenance.
  You don't have to fear the needles. They are so small that you can barely see them. Although there are approximately 80 needles in your face, you will feel very relaxed listening to the soft music and the trickle of water from the nearby fountain. A serene experience in the most tranquil setting.
  As an added bonus, Dr. Marina uses GM Collin Skincare products, prime partners of the Oscars. As part of your 10 sessions, you will get 3 facials with your choice of the following masks: a vitamin C mask which fills your skin with enough vitamin C to fight free radicals, strengthen the skin against sun damage, and boost collagen production to give you firmer, smoother skin; or an incredibly healing algae mask which hydrates, softens, and detoxifies the skin, replenishing it with essential vitamins and minerals.
  Acupuncture has been practiced for centuries. It encourages the body to promote natural healing, alleviating aches and pains, promoting digestion, aiding in sleep, calming the mind, and now making you look younger! Dr. Marina is excited to be at the forefront of this wellness movement.",,12:00PM - 12:00AM,Awaken Now,$400 per session ,https://www.discoverlosangeles.com/event/2019/06/17/awaken-now-acupuncture-and-wellness-center

Even though Leipzig did not enjoy the same illustrious reputation of Dresden, Venice, Paris, or Vienna during the Baroque era, it was a burgeoning musical scene that would eventually be recognized over time because of two composers who started and continued a tradition of performing music for the benefit of its townsfolk.

335,Opening Reception Of Dogtown The Pups Of Venice Beach And Their Humans An,"On August 17, 2024 the Venice Arts Gallery celebrates
the opening of DOGTOWN: The Pups of Venice Beach and Their Humans, featuring photographer Dotan Saguy’s latest body of work. The show features 57 quirky, heartfelt, candid photographs of our four-legged Venetian friends shot in black and white on Saguy’s Leica.
This exhibition celebrates the publication of Saguy’s newest monograph, DOGTOWN, published by Kehrer Verlag. Saguy's book is so reminiscent of Elliott Erwitt’s legacy on dogs that B+W Photography Magazine writes, “It’s a shame Erwitt never got to see this book, but Saguy’s showcase is a fitting tribute to Erwitt and sits well alongside the great photographer's own work.” Sadly, Erwitt recently passed away in late 2023.
Saguy’s last exhibit at Venice Arts Gallery was in 2018 and was titled Venice Beach, The Last Days of a Bohemian Paradise. About returning to the Venice Arts Gallery to show his work, Saguy says, “The projects I shoot in Venice, such as DOGTOWN, are a labor of love that is first and foremost meant to be shared with the local community, and I can’t think of a better place to do just that than at Venice Arts.”
The opening reception will be held on August 17 from 4:00 to 7:00 p.m., and the show runs through September 24, 2024. Gallery Hours are M-F, 10AM - 4PM and by appointment. Closed Labor Day. Admission is free. Reserve your ticket at dotandogtown.eventbrite.com
The artist is donating a percentage of all image and book sales to support Venice Arts’ free photography programs for low-income young people.

339,Architectural Pottery Ceramics For A Modern Landscape,"AMOCA is pleased to present Architectural Pottery: Ceramics for a Modern Landscape, a new exhibition exploring the significant impact of mid-twentieth-century architecture and design on artists in California.
In 1945, the Case Study House program was launched by Arts + Architecture magazine. The program commissioned some of architecture’s greatest talents—including Richard Neutra, Charles and Ray Eames, and Eero Saarinen—to study, plan, design, and build houses in anticipation of increased demand for housing at the end of WWII. The Los Angeles-based program created 36 prototype homes with published plans for modern residences that could be easily and inexpensively constructed. These mid-century modern homes are characterized by wide open spaces, expansive walls of glass, and flat roofs, with an emphasis on blending the interior with exterior spaces to erase boundaries between nature and the built environment.
In 1949, Lagardo Tackett (1911-1992), a Los Angeles-based ceramic artist and professor, challenged his students with a design assignment: to create forms that would fit the interior and garden spaces of these new modern homes. The students created simple, reﬁned forms to be used as planters and further accentuate indoor and outdoor spaces; they later staged an exhibition at a local nursery. Max and Rita Lawrence, who attended the exhibition, became intrigued with the concept. The Lawrences partnered with two student designers, John Follis and Rex Goode, and founded the Architectural Pottery company in 1950. Within twenty years, the company grew into a vibrant manufactory with a design line of several hundred products, including some of the most enduring forms in mid-century modernism.
Architectural Pottery: Ceramics for a Modern Landscape is curated by Jo Lauria, AMOCA’s Adjunct Curator.
The exhibition brings together work by the largely under-recognized ceramic artists and graphic and industrial designers Marilyn Kay Austin, Raul Angulo Coronel, David Cressey, Aurilla Doerner, Al Eggleston, John Follis, Leon Galleto, Rex Goode, Frank Krueger, Malcolm Leland, Paul McCobb, Jack Morris, Gordon Newell, LaGardo Tackett.
Also on view will be contemporary photographs by Chavkin, period photographs of Architectural Pottery planters in situ in mid-century modern residences by Julius Shulman (Getty Research Institute Archive), original catalogs and ephemera from Architectural Pottery sourced from private collections, and reproductions of company materials from the UCLA Library Special Collection.
The exhibition will be accompanied by a book from Monacelli Press, featuring full color images and new essays by Jo Lauria, Dan Chavkin, and Jeffery Head.
This exhibition and accompanying book are supported, in part, by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors through the Department of Arts and Culture. AMOCA would also like to thank the many collectors of Architectural Pottery for generously lending works for the exhibition and Monacelli Press for their support and editorial guidance.",Aug 17,11:00AM - 4:00PM,American Museum of Ceramic Art,$14 ,https://www.discoverlosangeles.com/event/2024/08/17/architectural-pottery-ceramics-for-a-modern-landscape
